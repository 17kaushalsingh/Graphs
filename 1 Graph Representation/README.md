# Basic Terms and Representation of Graphs

## Types of graphs
- Undirected graphs <br>
- Directed graphs

## Cycles in a graph
- Cyclic graph <br>
- Acyclic graph

## Path

## Degree of a node: Number of edges attached to a node
- In Degree of a node: Number of incoming edges to a node <br>
- Out Degree of  node: Number of outgoing edges to a node <br>
- Total Degree = 2 x Number of edges

## Edges
- Directed Graph <br>
- Undirected Graph

## Edge Weights

## Graph Representation
- Adjacency Matrix: Time: Nodes, Space: NodesxEdges <br>
- Adjacency List: Time: Nodes, Space: 2xEdges

## Connected Components
- Always use a visited bool array to make sure you reach each component of a graph using any traversal technique <br>
- Any traversal algorithms traverses only the connected component of the graph
