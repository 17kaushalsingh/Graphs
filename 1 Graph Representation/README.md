# Basic Terms and Representation of Graphs
## Types of graphs
    - Undirected graphs
    - Directed graphs

## Cycles in a graph
    - Cyclic graph
    - Acyclic graph

## Path

## Degree of a node: Number of edges attached to a node
    - In Degree of a node: Number of incoming edges to a node
    - Out Degree of  node: Number of outgoing edges to a node
    - Total Degree = 2 x Number of edges

## Edges
    - Directed Graph
    - Undirected Graph

## Edge Weights

## Graph Representation
    - Adjacency Matrix: Time: Nodes, Space: NodesxEdges
    - Adjacency List: Time: Nodes, Space: 2xEdges

## Connected Components
    - Always use a visited bool array to make sure you reach each component of a graph using any traversal technique
    - Any traversal algorithms traverses only the connected component of the graph
